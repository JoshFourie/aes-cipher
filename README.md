# Repository Notice: Archived

This repository is archived. It is an unfinished implementation of an AES cipher in Rust. It is neither fast, secure nor useful. It *might* give you an idea of how the theoretical cipher works...

THIS IS A NON-PRODUCTION LIBRARY. DO NOT USE THIS. IT IS NOT SECURE.

I am using this library for my own purposes. The idea is to iteratively improve the code by running my own cryptanalysis and attacks.

If you would like to get in contact feel free to reach out to me.
